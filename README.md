Grid Presets
=================

For ExpressionEngine

Adds the ability to save and load Grid field values. Useful for duplicating or pre-populating Grid content.


This enables you to save existing content within a Grid which can later be loaded into another of the same field.

Simply click the Save button and give it a name to create a new preset. 
You can also overwrite existing presets or delete them.

This can also be used to speed up content population for testing purposes while in development.

Supports basic fields, including P&amp;T Fieldpack fields.
